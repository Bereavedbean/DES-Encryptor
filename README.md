# DES-Decryptor
This Decrypts DES verbosely to allow you to see the internals of the DES encryption algorithm.

The code could be more efficient and readable, but it's made in python for demosntration purposes. If I were to make this for an application, it would be in C, C++ or Java. But at that point, you shouldn't be using DES in the first place for security purposes.
